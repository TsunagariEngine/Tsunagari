As one may notice, Tsunagari powers graphical video games. To achieve smooth
frame rates, graphics are accelerated with OpenGL.

Rather than manipulate OpenGL directly, the Gosu library (libgosu.org) is
employed. Gosu provides a simple interface for simple graphical manipulation. It
was originally selected to work with as it was quick to get an application up
and running.

As Tsunagari has developed, it has started to run into limitations in Gosu. For
instance, Gosu is unnecessarily slow when reading a large image that contains a
two-dimensional array of subimages, a format used for tilesets. It also does not
support a large number of platforms; Android is not supported at all.

While trying to work around these limitations, at some point we ended up
spending too much time patching and adding to Gosu and less working on our
engine. Eventually we realized that the best course of action would likely be to
abandon Gosu entirely in favor of a more developed alternative.

SDL is a polished library used by numerous projects, especially games. It
supports every platform for which support could conceivably exist, and while
slightly less "pretty" to work with, it does not suffer the same technological
limitations as Gosu. Moving forward, we have decided to use SDL instead of Gosu.

Switching game libraries will be a lengthy and involved task, and will not be
completed for some time.
