If we move into an Area with the same intro and main music as the last one, we
keep playing music with no changes.

A couple questions, though:
 * Fading out: When we move to another Area, should we fade out the currently
   playing track or end it immediately?
 * Wait for fading out: When we move to another Area, should wait for the
   currently playing track to end before starting the new music or do we start
   it immediately upon moving in?
 * Fading in: When we move to another Area, should we fade in the new track or
   start playing it immediately at full volume?
 * Different intro music, same main music: Should we stop playing the main
   music of the old Area to play the intro of the new or should we just keep
   playing the main?
 * Should we let world builders customize fade in/out times?

Of course, it would also be possible to make most of these options into
customizable values that world builders can change for their own world, but
we would still need good defaults.


We should eventually move all of these options for music handling into the
area's onLoad event script, while leaving the music options in the area
properties only for backwards compatibility.
