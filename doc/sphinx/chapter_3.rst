Chapter 3 - Map Editing

The "Tiled" Map Editor
======================

Rather than having its own map editor, Tsunagari uses "Tiled" for map creation and editing. Tiled is a program that allows you to easily create a map for use in a 2D game. It outputs TMX format map files, a format which Tsunagari is written to use.

Maps are the most important part of a game world. In order to create them, you'll need to grab a copy of Tiled from its website.

Tiled is not an OmegaSDG project.
