Tsunagari allows world creators to control and change many aspects of the world
in response to what a player does while playing. This is accomplished through
the scripting language of Python.

Tsunagari uses the CPython implementation of Python for its portability and
body of established documentation. CPython is not without flaws, however, and
we have concerns about its safety in Tsunagari. We at PariahSoft both do not
understand CPython in its entirety well and we have been discouraged in its
suitability for running unsanitized code from third parties. We have done our
best to block the most dangerous attack vectors that we know about. Thus, it is
with caution that we advocate our users download and run third party Tsunagari
worlds as they may contain malicious Python that we have not anticipated.

Regarding the future of Tsunagari scripting security, PyPy may be a possible
alternative to CPython. At the time of this writing, April 2013, PariahSoft
would like to keep options open for creating Android and iOS builds, but PyPy
does not support ARM. More importantly, PyPy does not implement much of the C
API which Tsunagari so intimately uses. In the future when PyPy supports ARM
and the C API, ParahSoft may weigh switching to it as Tsunagari's scripting
backend.
