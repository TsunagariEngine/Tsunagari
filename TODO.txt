ITEMS

* Sprite doesn't support animations.

* Avoid window damage when another window moves on top.
  We have an optimization that makes our window only redraw itself if something
  in the game world changed. This causes redraw requests when another window is
  passing over us to be ignored.

  Gosu might be forked to be explicit about the difference between timer-based
  redraw requests and ones spawned by window damage.

  Gosu already has a Window::loseFocus() method. What would it take to have a
  gainFocus()?

* Support multiple TileSets per TMX map.

* Area Tiles should support animations.

* Add brief or brief+long Doxygen Documentation to all public and private
  classes, functions, structs, and enums.

* Create our own C++ wrapper of libxml2 so we can use std::strings to avoid memory leaks.

* Expire items in resource cache.

* Support for persistent music.

* Preserve aspect ratio in fullscreen.

* Resourcer should hand out vector<ImageRef> for tilesheet-based graphics in
  Area and Sprite. This way they can use ImageRef instead of Image*.

* Try moving descriptor filenames from constructors + class members to init()
  parameters.
