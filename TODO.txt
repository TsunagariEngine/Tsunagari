ITEMS

* Add brief or brief+long Doxygen Documentation to all public and private
  classes, functions, structs, and enums.

* Preserve aspect ratio in fullscreen.

* Set width and height of viewport (in tiles) in world.conf.

* Try moving descriptor filenames from constructors + class members to init()
  parameters.

* Diagonal movement in all modes with correct input detection.

* Diagonal movement should not work at corners in Yume Nikki mode.

* Entity movement speed should be declared in Entity descriptor.

* Package our own Lua so that it can be built as C++ with g++ (and whatever on
  Windows). Being built as C causes lua_error() to use longjmp which doesn't
  play well with C++ deconstructors, leading to memory leaks on Lua errors if
  a C++ callback is in the callstack.
