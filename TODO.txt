ITEMS

* Add brief or brief+long Doxygen Documentation to all public and private
  classes, functions, structs, and enums.

* Preserve aspect ratio in fullscreen.

* Set width and height of viewport (in tiles) in world.conf.

* Try moving descriptor filenames from constructors + class members to init()
  parameters.

* Diagonal movement in all modes with correct input detection.

* Diagonal movement at corners should only work in Roguelike.

* Investigate Guichan

* Investigate PhysicsFS for world file access and event script jailing.

* The player's speed should actually change as they start to enter a speed
  modified tile. We may need to rethink event timing.

* Resourcer returns Script rather than lua_State*
  Move bytecode functions and stuff to Script.

* Stream music rather than loading it all at once. This will massively reduce
  loading time.

* Can we create a metatable for a userdata? Is that what liolib.c does? Right
  now we use a table object with userdata set at table.object.

* Unify how tile scripts and entity scripts are stored.

* Entity animations should respect speedMul.

* On teleport and on initial placement into map, apply tile onEnter.

* Unify XML element/attribute naming scheme.

* Support TMX zlib data.

* Investigate using Gosu::Song with OpenAL, then with OpenAL+zip.

* Separate Resourcer from file. Resourcer should be able to access multiple
  file sources.

* Move some flags into unsigned:1

* Investigate LÃ–VE @ http://love2d.org/

* If the game is started while holding an arrow key down, that keyboard state
  is normalized to not moving, which will cause your character to move when you
  let go.
