* Command line interface using popt.

* Sprite doesn't support animations.

* Give World::player an Entity descriptor file.
  What does an Entity descriptor file contain? What is an Entity?
  ->	Entity is the most complicated descriptor. It will take a while to
  	design. It's the only descriptor with multiple types which are each
  	different. It's possible that each type of entity will require a
  	different DTD.

* Avoid window damage when another window moves on top.
  We have an optimization that makes our window only redraw itself if something
  in the game world changed. This causes redraw requests when another window is
  passing over us to be ignored.

  Gosu might be forked to be explicit about the difference between timer-based
  redraw requests and ones spawned by window damage.

  Gosu already has a Window::loseFocus() method. What would it take to have a
  gainFocus()?

* Support multiple TileSets per TMX map.

* Area Tiles should support animations.

* Refactor the movement polling code from buttonDown() into update().
  * Diagonal movement in roguelike mode.

* Move player handling code to its own class.
